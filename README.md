# SQL-Coursework
This is my work on the sql coursework in Year 2 Tri1 at Napier.

The purpose of this coursework was to query in the correct way a database (not made by me) in order to retrieve what the questions asked.
The questions I've answered to where:

11. Dangerous driving. For all trips where hazardous good were transported, find the
percentage of each category of item in the manifest. Sort in descending order of the percentage of hazardous items. (NB Outputis abbreviated â€“ in your submission, all 48
rows should be included.)

12. Unused trucks. List the registration numbers of the trucks that were not in use between
1 and 5 May inclusive.

13. Bonus. If a driver works more than 24 days in any one month, they are paid at a higher
rate for the extra days. List the drivers who qualify for bonus payments for each month
in the data and include the number of extra days worked. Drivers who are not eligible
for a bonus should not be shown. Order by month and number of days descending.

14. Keeping busy. Find the driver who transported the largest number of items in a single
week.

15. Capacity factor.100% capacity is when every truck is in use every day. If some trucks are
idle, the capacity factor is less than 100%. What is the total capacity factor for the
company for the time period covered by the data?
